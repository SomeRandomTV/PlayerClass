## Player Class for Monopoly Project
This class is separated into 3 files: main.cpp, playerClass.hpp, and playerClass.cpp

The main.cpp file was used to test the functions from the playerClass before adding it to the overall monopoly project.
playerClass.hpp is just a header file that contains all the header functions and only delcares them. 
playerClass.cpp uses the header functions from playerClass.hpp and initializes them. 
All the functions in the playerClass are user-defined as in the user interacts with them. 
These functions set the player bank account, position, properties owned by the player and anything else that deals with the player. 
The functions that have "set" in the name are responsible to changing the data memebers in the class 
The functions with "get" in the name are responsible to retrieving the data for display.
